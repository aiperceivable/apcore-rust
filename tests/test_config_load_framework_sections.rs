//! Load-path coverage for the framework sections that had none
//! (apcore-rust#34).
//!
//! ## Which sections, and how they were found
//!
//! `src/config.rs` names a config section in six different places, and the
//! coverage guard (`tests/test_config_load_coverage_guard.rs`) was reading
//! five of them: `CONFIG_DEFAULTS`, the built-in namespace registrations, the
//! constrained-key table, the required-field list and the reserved names. It
//! was **not** reading [`FRAMEWORK_SECTION_KEYS`] — the longest of the six, and
//! the only one projected from `schemas/apcore-config.schema.json`.
//!
//! Seven sections appear only there, and an audit of every `Config::load`-family
//! call in `tests/` confirmed that not one of them was ever written into a real
//! config file by a test:
//!
//! | section | declared by a load test | asserted after load |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `bindings` | no | no |
//! | `id_map` | no | no |
//! | `logging` | no | no |
//! | `middleware` | no | no |
//! | `obs` | only indirectly[^obs] | via `RedactionConfig`, not `Config` |
//! | `pipeline` | no | no |
//! | `validation` | no | no |
//!
//! [^obs]: `tests/test_redaction_config_conformance.rs` builds an `apcore.yaml`
//! at run time from a conformance fixture and loads it, so `obs.redaction.*`
//! does reach `Config::load` — but it asserts through `RedactionConfig`, never
//! through `Config::get` / `Config::namespace`, and the fixture is assembled
//! dynamically so no static audit of the test sources can see it. It is covered
//! here as well, directly through the `Config` readers.
//!
//! That is the same state `observability` was in the day before #33 and
//! `executor` the day before its own gap: an operator can declare the section,
//! `schemas/apcore-config.schema.json` blesses it, and nothing verified that a
//! value written into a file survives to a reader.
//!
//! ## Every `Config` here comes from a file
//!
//! No test in this file may be rewritten to use `Config::from_defaults()` +
//! `.set(…)`. `set` writes into `user_namespaces` — a shadow entry no YAML file
//! can produce — and skips `Config::deserialize`, which is the single step #33
//! broke. Rewriting these onto `set` would delete the only thing being tested.
//!
//! ## The two assertions per section
//!
//! 1. **`get` returns the file's value.** Paired with
//!    [`absent_sections_are_not_invented`], which proves the value could only
//!    have come from the file: none of these seven sections has an entry in
//!    `CONFIG_DEFAULTS`, so an undeclared one resolves to `None`. Without that
//!    control, a reader that ignored the file could still pass by answering
//!    from the default table — which is exactly how a broken loader stays
//!    green.
//!
//! 2. **`namespace()` reflects the file.** For `observability` and
//!    `sys_modules` this means "rather than the registered §9.15 default",
//!    because those two are the only sections with a registered default layer
//!    underneath (`init_builtin_namespaces`), and that layer answering in place
//!    of the operator's value *was* #33. None of the seven sections here has
//!    such a layer, so the reachable form of the same assertion is the
//!    invariant both #33 and #34 actually violated —
//!    [`namespace_agrees_with_get_for_every_declared_key`]: two readers over
//!    one namespace must not disagree. That is checked per key, in both modes,
//!    alongside an exact whole-subtree comparison
//!    ([`namespace_returns_exactly_the_files_subtree`]) so a reader that
//!    invented a key or dropped one fails even where `get` agrees with it.
//!
//! Registering a namespace with conflicting defaults would exercise the
//! shadowing case literally, but `Config::register_namespace` writes to a
//! process-global registry; this file lives in the consolidated `tests/it.rs`
//! binary and must not mutate global state that its file-mates share.
//!
//! [`FRAMEWORK_SECTION_KEYS`]: apcore::config::FRAMEWORK_SECTION_KEYS
