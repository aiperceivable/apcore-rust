//! PROTOCOL_SPEC §9.2.4 / §9.2.4.1 — the deprecation notice for the
//! declared configuration keys that reach no consumer in any SDK
//! (aiperceivable/apcore#118).
//!
//! Two warnings, one per document kind:
//!
//! | Document | Emitted by | Marker |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `apcore.yaml` | `Config::warn_deprecated_inert_keys` | `DEPRECATION (spec §9.2.4)` |
//! | an ACL file | `ACL::load` | `DEPRECATION (spec §9.2.4.1)` |
//!
//! ## Every case here asserts BOTH halves, and the negative one is the point
//!
//! A test that only checks "a config declaring `logging.level` warns" would
//! have passed the **broken** first implementation of this warning, which fired
//! for every configuration ever loaded — including clean ones.
//!
//! The reason is specific to this SDK and is why these cases exist. The notice
//! MUST be driven by the **as-written** document (§9.2.4 requirement 2), and
//! neither of the two obvious sources can supply that: `observability` is a
//! typed struct field whose leaves always carry a value, so
//! `Config::get_declared("observability.tracing.enabled")` answers `Some(false)`
//! for a document that never mentions it, and `Config::data()` serialises the
//! same typed fields. Measured on the first attempt: a clean config reported
//! four declared keys. The implementation reads `user_namespaces` instead,
//! which retains the raw object of every typed section exactly as the file
//! wrote it — so [`a_clean_configuration_is_silent`] and
//! [`a_declared_section_with_no_deprecated_leaf_is_silent`] are the cases that
//! hold it to that source, and would go red the moment it went back to either
//! of the others.
//!
//! The ACL half has a third negative for a different reason. The notice lives
//! in the loader — the ACL file is parsed into a `serde_json::Value` whose
//! unrecognised root keys are dropped in silence, so deleting the `audit` block
//! from `acl-config.schema.json` would produce no signal at all — and it is
//! scoped to `audit` **deliberately**. It is a deprecation notice, not unknown-
//! key closure for ACL files, so
//! [`an_acl_file_with_an_unrelated_unknown_root_key_is_silent`] pins that every
//! other unrecognised root key keeps being ignored exactly as before.
//!
//! ## What is NOT asserted
//!
//! Behaviour. §9.2.4 requirement 3 keeps every listed key parsing, validating,
//! answering `get()` and passing `_config.strict` for the whole 1.x line; the
//! `audit:` block keeps being ignored. Nothing in this file loads a
//! configuration that would fail before the warning existed, and nothing here
//! reads a value back — this is a diagnostic, and the diagnostic is the only
//! thing that changed.
