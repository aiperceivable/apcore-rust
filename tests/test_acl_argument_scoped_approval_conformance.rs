//! Conformance driver for `acl_argument_scoped_approval.json`
//! (PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.1.1 / §6.1.6 / §6.1.7 / §6.1.8 / §6.8.1 / §6.9,
//! spec v1.28.0 apcore#108, extended v1.29.0 apcore#109).
//!
//! An ACL rule answers two independent questions — may this caller reach this
//! target at all, and must *this particular call* be put to a human first. The
//! orthogonal `approval` field carries the second, and the built-in
//! structure-only `arguments` condition decides whether a rule matches this
//! call.
//!
//! # Every case runs twice
//!
//! The `arguments` condition can only be answered when a governance projection
//! is available, and §6.1.8 case 1 makes `check()` a public entry point that
//! may be called without one — so the same rules and the same call have two
//! well-defined answers, and both are contracts. Run 1 supplies a projection
//! derived from `arguments`; run 2 supplies NO PROJECTION AT ALL. Keys ending
//! `_no_projection` belong to run 2, the unsuffixed ones to run 1.
//! `arguments: null` means the case has no projection to supply in either run,
//! so the two runs coincide.
//!
//! **What this SDK can and cannot assert.** `ACL::check(caller_id, target_id,
//! ctx)` has no parameter for a projection and passes `None` to `check_access`
//! internally. That is conforming — §6.1.8 rule 4 fixes only that the
//! *condition* sees the projection, and §6.1.8 case 1 contemplates `check()`
//! being called without one — so the legacy boolean here answers run 2's
//! question, and `expected_legacy_check_no_projection` is the column it is
//! asserted against, on every case. `expected_legacy_check` (run 1's boolean,
//! for an SDK whose `check()` does take a projection) is the ONE key this
//! driver cannot assert; asserting it would be asserting the answer to a
//! different question. Both STRUCTURED columns remain fully assertable via
//! `check_access(.., Some(&projection))` and `check_access(.., None)`, which
//! is what makes the unassertable key a single boolean rather than a hole.
//!
//! This two-column contract replaces a driver-side skip. The skip was honest
//! and reconciled against the fixture, but it left 17 of 20 cases unverified
//! here, and apcore#109 — an unevaluable `allow` rule discarding the
//! `approval: required` it carried, so a broader rule granted the call
//! unapproved — was sitting in exactly those cases.
//!
//! The two cases worth reading before the rest are
//! `no_projection_must_not_grant_via_an_empty_stand_in` and
//! `no_projection_makes_a_deny_rule_take_effect`: they bracket the same
//! fail-open bug from both directions. Substituting an empty key set for an
//! absent projection makes `has_none_of` vacuously satisfied, so an `allow`
//! rule grants for a call whose arguments were never seen — and leaves
//! `has_key` unsatisfied, so a `deny` rule fails to take effect. Only the
//! UNEVALUABLE reading of §6.1.8 rule 1 refuses in both directions.
